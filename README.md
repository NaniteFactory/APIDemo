# How to used Doxygen with GitHUB

This is a simple demo for hosting Doxygen Code on Github.  All of the instructions herein are based on the command line and was tested on a mac.

Much of the information here was adapted from [Rick Foos](http://rickfoosusa.blogspot.com/2011/10/howto-use-doxygen-with-github.html) blog on the subject.

This [GitHUB project](https://github.com/smartell/APIDemo) acts as a simple example.  Another simple example can be found at at [MSEDemo](https://github.com/smartell/MSEdemo), and the corresponding Doxygen generated documentation at [MSEDemoAPI](http://smartell.github.io/MSEdemo/)

## Doxygen
[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) is a tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ source files, and it also supports other platforms as well. You must have a copy of Doxygen installed on your computer, as this program is necessary to generate the html files from your annotated C++ code.

## Git

[Git](http://git-scm.com) is a free open source distributed version control system that is now widely used by many of major software developers for version control (e.g., Goolge, Netflix, Microsoft).  It was originally developed for maintaining the Linux kerenel.  [GitHUB](https://github.com) is a web-based repository for storing your projects (such as this one) and is free for open source projects. You will also need to install Git on your computer and setup a GitHUB account if you do not already have one.

The following are a series of ([Terminal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X))  instructions for setting up and hosting Doxygen output in the GitHUB pages section of your project.
